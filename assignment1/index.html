								<p>Greetings! My name is Adam Mattas. I have been learning to develop websites for nearly three years now. While acquiring these new skills I have been able to offer my assistance to friends, family members, and even a non-profit organization. I am glad to say that I was able to provide them with a web presence they can be proud of.</p>

								<p>My career as a developer began in 2013, when I decided that I was going to start building a site for original musicians. This site would be dynamic, eye catching, and finished in no time. And really, why wouldn't it be? Well, since I am still attempting to construct <a class="p-link" href="http://audiotheory.com/" target="_blank">AudioTheory.com</a>, I guess time really does make fools of us all.</p>

								<p class="no-bottom-margin">The challenges that are presented while learning to code can be daunting. However, overcoming the obstacles I have encountered has been equally rewarding.</p>
